## Memory Exploit Game üíæüïπÔ∏è

### Introduction
Memory Exploit Game is a command-line game on Linux where you manipulate memory to influence gameplay dynamics. The challenge includes guessing characters (m, a, s, t, e, r) to maintain your balance without running out.

### Game Dynamics
- **Initial Balance:** 300
- **Guessing Mechanism:** Choose characters (m, a, s, t, e, r).
- **Outcome:**
  - Correct Guess: Balance x2.
  - Incorrect Guess: Deduct 100 from balance.
- **Game Termination:** Balance hits 0, displaying the number of moves made.
- **Endless Play:** Continues indefinitely if you keep guessing correctly.

### Hack Script (hack.sh)
Use `hack.sh` to gain privileged access and manipulate memory to cheat the game. The game's challenge includes code segments placed in the heap, increasing the difficulty of cheating effectively.

### Usage
1. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   ./game
   ```
   Start the command-line game.

2. **Use Hack Script:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./hack.sh
   ```
   Access and manipulate memory to influence game outcomes.

### Purpose
Explore memory exploitation techniques to modify game behavior on Linux systems without source code access.
